I am Tikeswar Naik,web development enthusiasit. Throught the journey of leaning, It has given me multiple insights about how the web works and gets me excited to explore more on it.

During my college placement, to make a project I got to learn `HTML`, `CSS` and a little bit of `JS`. Since then I am in love with these. I choose to make my carrer on web development, particularly fullstack development. Besides these languages, I have also learnt `ReactJS` library and `NextJS` framework for UI development and love some new framework `Svelte` and `Astro` for the new things they bring in. For the backend, I have been using `NodeJS` , `ExpressJS` with `MongoDB` database.
