My name is Tikeswar Naik, and I love web development. It has provided me with numerous insights into how the web functions throughout my learning process and motivates me to learn more about it.

While working on a project for my college placement, I had the opportunity to learn `HTML`, `CSS`, and `JS`. I've been in love with these ever since. I've decided to pursue a career in web development, especially full-stack development. In addition to these languages, I have also learned how to create user interfaces using the `NextJS` framework and `ReactJS` library. I enjoy some new frameworks, such as `Svelte` and `Astro`, for the fresh ideas they introduce. I've been using `NodeJS` and `ExpressJS` with the `MongoDB` database for the backend.
